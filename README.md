# TextEngine

This is an old personal project that used ncurses to make games with ASCII art. It had a basic game loop with Z-indexing and even animation! Alas, it was poorly written and buggy.

I'm currently rewriting it to use OpenGL and FreeType. It's an attempt to teach myself about basic game engine architecture.

I'd also like to integrate it with Lua for fun.
